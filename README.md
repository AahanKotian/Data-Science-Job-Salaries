I developed an interactive HR analytics dashboard using Power BI for a company, enabling analysis and visualization of employee data. The dashboard offers insights into workforce trends over time, including headcount growth, employment types, common job titles, experience levels, salaries, and employee locations. Key features include interactive charts, filters, map visualizations, currency conversion, tooltips, and data formatting for easy interpretation. The dashboard benefits HR and management by providing centralized access to workforce analytics, facilitating informed decision-making on compensation, skills gaps, diversity metrics, and strategic planning.
